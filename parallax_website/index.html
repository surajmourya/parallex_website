    <h2>What is Coding? For me</h2>
    <p>
      Coding is the process of creating software applications, websites, and other digital products by writing instructions using a programming language. 
      It is a creative and analytical process that involves problem-solving and attention to detail. Coding is used in many areas of technology, from developing mobile apps and video games to building complex software systems. For me, coding is a tool that allows me to bring my ideas to life and solve problems in a logical and structured way. 
      It's a challenging and rewarding activity that constantly challenges me to learn and grow.
